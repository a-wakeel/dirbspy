# dirbspy (Under development)
A friendly Python API interface for Device Identification Registration &amp; Blocking System (https://github.com/dirbs/DIRBS-Core)

## Development Environment Setup
I have used poetry as the dependency manager for this project and is recommended to use,
however others can also be used.
- Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/a-wakeel/dirbspy.git
    ```
- Install the dependencies (provided that you already have poetry installed):
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
  Now you can use it in the development mode.
  
- Invoke the test suit using:
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
- Invoke the linter using:
    ```bash
    make lint
    ```
